Overview: Java Program to Track and Manage Student Grades
This task involves creating a Java program that allows users to track and manage student grades for different subjects or assignments. The program should enable the user to:

Input Grades: The user will enter grades for various subjects or assignments.
Calculate Average Grade: The program will compute the average grade based on the grades entered.
Determine Letter Grade: It should convert the average grade into a letter grade based on a predefined grading scale.
Calculate GPA: The program will also compute the GPA corresponding to the average grade.
Display Results: Finally, the program will display the average grade, letter grade, and GPA, along with any other relevant information.
Key Features
Grade Input: The program will prompt the user to enter a certain number of grades (for each subject/assignment).
Average Calculation: The program will compute the average grade.
Letter Grade Conversion: Based on the average, the program will convert it into a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.).
GPA Calculation: The program will map the average grade to a GPA (on a 4.0 scale).
Error Handling: It will handle potential errors (e.g., division by zero) and provide user-friendly messages.
Design
Input: The user will be asked to input the number of subjects or assignments and the grades for each.
Calculation:
Average: Sum the grades and divide by the number of subjects.
Letter Grade: Use the average to determine the letter grade.
GPA: Map the average grade to a GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Output: Display the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

Conclusion:
This Java program is a simple yet effective way to track and manage student grades. It allows users to input grades, calculates the average, and provides valuable feedback in the form of a letter grade and GPA. This is a useful tool for students, teachers, or anyone who needs to manage academic performance.
